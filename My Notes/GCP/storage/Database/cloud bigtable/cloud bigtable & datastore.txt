Cloud Bigtable:

Cloud Bigtable is Google's fully managed NoSQL Big Data database service. 
It's the same database that powers many core Google services, including Search, Analytics, Maps, and Gmail.
Cloud Bigtable is a sparsely populated table that can scale to billions of rows and thousands of columns, enabling you to store terabytes or even petabytes of data.
A single value in each row is indexed; this value is known as the row key. 
     Bigtable is ideal for storing very large amounts of single-keyed data with very low latency.
	 
	 
What it's good for

Bigtable is ideal for applications that need very high throughput and scalability for key/value data, where each value is typically no larger than 10 MB. 
Bigtable also excels as a storage engine for batch MapReduce operations, stream processing/analytics, and machine-learning applications.

Bigtable storage model
Bigtable stores data in massively scalable tables, each of which is a sorted key/value map. 
The table is composed of rows, each of which typically describes a single entity, and columns, which contain individual values for each row.
Each row is indexed by a single row key, and columns that are related to one another are typically grouped together into a column family. 
Each column is identified by a combination of the column family and a column qualifier, which is a unique name within the column family.

Nearline Storage is a better choice than Standard Storage in scenarios where slightly lower availability, 
   a 30-day minimum storage duration, and costs

Storage Class-Coldline Storage

Minimum storage duration-90 days
Coldline Storage is a very-low-cost, highly durable storage service for storing infrequently accessed data.
Coldline Storage is a better choice than Standard Storage or Nearline Storage in scenarios where slightly lower availability, 
   a 90-day minimum storage duration, and higher costs

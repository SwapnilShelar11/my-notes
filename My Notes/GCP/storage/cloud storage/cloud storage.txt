What is Cloud Storage?
 1.
Cloud Storage is a service for storing your objects in Google Cloud. An object is an immutable piece of data consisting of a file of any format.
You store objects in containers called buckets. All buckets are associated with a project, and you can group your projects under an organization.
 2.
After you create a project, you can create Cloud Storage buckets, upload objects to your buckets, and download objects from your buckets.
You can also grant permissions to make your data accessible to principals you specify, 
  or - for certain use cases such as hosting a website - accessible to everyone on the public internet.

Compute Engine:

Compute Engine is a computing and hosting service that lets you create and run virtual machines on Google infrastructure.
Compute Engine offers scale, performance, and value that lets you easily launch large compute clusters on Google's infrastructure. 
Compute Engine instances can run the public images for Linux and Windows Server that Google provides as well as private custom images that you can create or import from your existing systems.
You can also deploy Docker containers, which are automatically launched on instances running the Container-Optimized OS public image.

Virtual machine instances:

An instance is a virtual machine (VM) hosted on Google's infrastructure. 
You can create an instance or create a group of managed instances by using the Google Cloud Console, the Google Cloud CLI, or the Compute Engine API.

Instances and projects
Each instance belongs to a Google Cloud Console project, and a project can have one or more instances. 
When you create an instance in a project, you specify the zone, operating system, and machine type of that instance.
When you delete an instance, it is removed from the project.

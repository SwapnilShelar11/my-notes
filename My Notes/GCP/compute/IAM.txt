IAM:

IAM lets you grant granular access to specific Google Cloud resources and helps prevent access to other resources.
IAM lets you adopt the security principle of least privilege, which states that nobody should have more permissions than they actually need.

How IAM Works
In IAM, permission to access a resource isn't granted directly to the end user. Instead, permissions are grouped into roles, and roles are granted to authenticated principals. 
(In the past, IAM often referred to principals as members. Some APIs still use this term.)

Principal. A principal can be a Google Account (for end users), a service account (for applications and compute workloads), a Google group, or a Google Workspace account or Cloud Identity domain that can access a resource. 
The identity of a principal is an email address associated with a user, service account, or Google group; 
or a domain name associated with a Google Workspace account or a Cloud Identity domain.

Role. A role is a collection of permissions. 
Permissions determine what operations are allowed on a resource. 
When you grant a role to a principal, you grant all the permissions that the role contains.
Policy. The IAM policy is a collection of role bindings that bind one or more principals to individual roles. 
When you want to define who (principal) has what type of access (role) on a resource, you create a policy and attach it to the resource.

In IAM, you grant access to principals. 
Principals can be of the following types:

Google Account
Service account
Google group
Google Workspace account
Cloud Identity domain
All authenticated users
All users
